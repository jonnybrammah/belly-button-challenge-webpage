## Project Description

This project is diving into the surprisingly disgusting world of belly buttons. The goal of this project was to visualize data about the microbes found in the belly buttons of different people in a dataset to show the most common microbes found, as well as the whole range, and the belly button washing frequency. This data was represented in three different visualizations and deployed to a website which you can find here: https://jonnybrammah.github.io/belly-button-challenge-webpage/. An image of the intialized webpage is also shown below:

## Data Extraction

The data was pulled from an [API of belly button information](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json). This API contained an array of "names" which were actually anonymized ids (like 940), and then a dictionary for each of these people containing some metadata. Finally, another dictionary contained an array all the microbe ids and labels for each person in the sample. This data was pulled and then stored as different variables in the app.js file.
